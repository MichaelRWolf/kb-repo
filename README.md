Knowledge base reorganization project.

This repo captures our approach for migrating from Confluence (and later Evernote / Dropbox)
into a Google Drive / Google Docs–centric workspace, in a way that:

- is **mechanical** and repeatable (no human "normalization" passes)
- avoids fragile, bespoke scripts and UI fuckery
- stays **Google-native** instead of trying to recreate Confluence inside Drive
- leaves the door open for a future **AI-first knowledge layer**

Current focus: **Confluence → Google Docs** migration.
Evernote and Dropbox files are placeholders for now.
