                    <p>HOUSE RULES:</p><p>Welcome to the 5 Day Facebook Group Doing Challenge Pop-Up Group...🤩</p><p>This challenge is designed to turn your Facebook Group into a client-getting machine, using our proven system to get your business in front of thousands of dream clients every month, and become a thought-leader in your niche!</p><p>So get ready for some serious Doing! 🙌</p><p>House Rules:</p><p>NO Facebook Group Promotion! We're here to learn how to build and grow your Facebook Groups, not to join each other. Don't post/comment links to your group or ask our members to join your group. Keep it fair for everyone.</p><p>NO lead capture, pitching, promoting, or selling. This includes promoting your online course in exchange for a testimonial, or other free lead captures.</p><p>NO independent &quot;accountability groups&quot;. Please do not set up groups post-challenge (We need to be weary of people taking advantage of our IP and using it for their gain, so stand by the premise that &quot;if everyone were to do it, it wouldn't be okay.&quot;) We have a free accountability group called The Doers Way you can join to stay connected post-challenge.</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedoersway/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedoersway/</a></p><p>NO Affiliate or External Links. Please don't post or comment your links to programs/resources outside of this group. Strictly NO AFFILIATE LINKS. Help with your words, stories and experiences instead, otherwise it deters from the challenge.</p><p>Keep it positive and helpful - This isn't a place to vent, rage, share emotional issues or complain. I promise you, a good girlfriend face-to-face and a glass of red is a wonderful way to share and download after a big week</p><p>Hook each other up! 🥰</p><p>Did something work a treat? Fill us in! Need recommendations? Ask and let us hook you up too! We love sharing our secrets in this group so be generous and enjoy! 🥳</p><p>Stay focused on &quot;doing&quot; the daily challenges - All challenges will be posted as &quot;announcements&quot; at the top of the group.</p><p>Don't be overly humble - Did you nail something? Let us celebrate with you! We love sharing wins, big or small and encourage you to be proud of what you're achieving xx</p><p>Let's enjoy this space, encourage and lift each other up, band together and break apart those myths, mindset blocks and limiting beliefs!</p><p>xx</p><p>Grace</p><p>P.S. Posts that don't follow our house rules will be deleted.</p>
