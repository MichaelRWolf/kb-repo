Chilhowie Reservoir, Calderwood Reservoir, Cheoah Reservoir - TN into NC <br />Three reservoirs on the Little Tennessee River in <strong>northwestern North Carolina and Southeastern Tennessee offer some of the most spectacular wilderness scenery in the eastern United States.</strong> The Finger Lakes of the South - Cheoah Lake, Calderwood Lake and Chilhowie Lake - provide hydroelectric power to Alcoa, Inc. for operation of its aluminum smelting operations. Ideally situated at the boundary between Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee National Forest, the three 'stairstep' reservoirs impound nearly 3000 acres of water along almost 30 miles of river.<br />The Finger Lakes of the South have no development along their shorelines. A number of primitive campsites are located along the shore, many of which are accessible only by water. All three have boat launch sites which are suitable for small fishing boats, canoes and kayaks. The dams serve to slow down the river, widening the waters into pleasant pools of scenic wonder teaming with fish. The wooded and rocky shoreline is overlooked by limestone bluffs in some areas, while others feature gentle slopes under the canopy of trees.
