# Hierarchy vs Search

## Confluence Era: Hierarchy + Links

Confluence blended:

- a **page tree** (hierarchy) for navigation
- **links** between pages for cross-references

Users were encouraged to browse via the left-hand tree and jump between related pages.
Location (where a page lived in the tree) carried a lot of meaning.

## Google Docs Era: Folders + Search

Google Docs expects:

- **folders** as a light organizational aid
- **search** as the primary way to find content

Users are not expected to click down deep trees. Instead, they:
- type a few words in Drive search
- rely on good document titles and recent items

## AI-First Era: Semantic Search

In an AI-first system:

- navigation becomes **“ask a question, see related notes”**
- hierarchy is mostly optional
- the system clusters and surfaces related content without explicit links

## Migration Implication

For our Confluence → Google Docs migration:

- We avoid re-creating complex Confluence hierarchies.
- We use **shallow folders** and **good titles**.
- We assume that **search (and later semantic search)** will be the primary navigation tool.
