# Folder Structure Guidelines (Google Drive)

We want a folder layout that is:

- **simple** enough to maintain
- **shallow** enough to avoid Confluence-style tree hell
- **predictable** so people know roughly where to look

## Recommended Shape

At the top level for knowledge work:

```text
/Knowledge
    /Engineering
    /Product
    /PeopleOps
    /Processes
    /Onboarding
```

Each folder contains **topic-sized docs**, not more folders, unless there is a very strong reason.

## Principles

- Prefer **one or two levels** of folders, no more.
- Do not mirror Confluence page trees.
- Group by broad area or function, not by arbitrary historical structure.
- Let **Drive search** and **clear naming** do most of the organizational work.

## Migration Note

For initial Confluence migration, we may keep the export’s folder structure mechanically.

Over time, we can:

- move docs into a simpler `/Knowledge/...` layout
- do so gradually, without blocking the migration itself
