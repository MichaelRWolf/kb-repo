# Atomic Notes

## Concept

Modern knowledge systems (Notion, Roam, Obsidian, Zettelkasten-style workflows) emphasize:

> **Atomic notes** — small, self-contained units of meaning.

An atomic note is:
- about one idea, one process, or one decision
- small enough to understand quickly
- large enough to be meaningful on its own

## Relationship to Confluence and Google Docs

- Confluence often had **micro-pages** (sometimes too small).
- Google Docs tends toward **larger, topic-sized docs** (sometimes too big).

Atomic notes are a **middle ground**:
- smaller than a big document/manual
- larger than a single bullet or one-line thought

## Migration Reality

For first-pass migration:

- We do **not** try to enforce atomicity by hand.
- We accept one-doc-per-page as a mechanical starting point.

Later, if needed, we can:
- split large docs into atomic notes (see `gdocs-atomic-chunking-pipeline.md`)
- merge trivial docs that obviously belong together

The key is: migration stays mechanical, refinement is optional and incremental.
