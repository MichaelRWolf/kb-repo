# Cross-Walk: Confluence → Google Docs → AI-First Knowledge Base

This table summarizes how the core organizational concepts map across:

- **Confluence** (wiki model, 2000s)
- **Google Drive / Docs** (document model, 2010s–2020s)
- **AI-first knowledge base** (semantic/atomic model, emerging)

## Concept Cross-Walk

| Concept | Confluence (Wiki Model) | Google Drive / Docs (Document Model) | AI-First Knowledge Base (Semantic / Atomic) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Primary unit of content** | Page | Document | Atomic Note (concept-sized) |
| **Granularity** | Very small (micro-pages) | Medium (topic-sized docs) | Small but meaningful (Zettel / idea-sized) |
| **Organization metaphor** | Hierarchy + Links | Folders + Search | Semantic clusters + embeddings |
| **Navigation** | Page tree (left nav) | Search-first | Semantic search (“find meaning, not just keywords”) |
| **Cross-linking** | Heavy; wiki links essential | Optional; @Doc links | Mostly automatic; AI proposes relationships |
| **Backlinks** | Manual; sometimes visible | None natively | Native; backlinks / graph views |
| **Parent/Child structure** | Strong; defines meaning | Weak; folders are containers | Minimal; meaning encoded in content/metadata |
| **Editing model** | Collaborative but page-based | Real-time multi-editor docs | Real-time edits + semantic change tracking |
| **Versioning** | Page history | Document history | Versioning + semantic diffs (“what changed in meaning?”) |
| **Indexing** | Human-maintained hierarchy | Title + full-text search | Embedding / vector index + metadata |
| **Tags / Metadata** | Optional, often underused | Simulated with text or Drive metadata | First-class: tags, properties, attributes |
| **Publishing** | Pages double as “articles” | Manuals, docs curated manually | Articles assembled from clusters of notes |
| **Best content shape** | Short, link-rich pages | Moderate, self-contained docs | Atomic, reusable notes with clear scope |
| **Strength** | Great for linking thought-to-thought | Great for finished artifacts | Great for discovery, reuse, assembly |
| **Weakness** | Deep trees become brittle | Folders alone don’t scale well | Needs discipline in note granularity + naming |
