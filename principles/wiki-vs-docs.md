# Wiki vs Docs

## What We Liked About Confluence (Wiki-ness)

Confluence worked well as a **wiki-like note-taking system**:

- many small pages
- easy linking between pages
- "everyone edits everything"
- living documents, not static publications
- collaborative scratchpads for teams

## What Google Docs Does Well

Google Docs excels at:

- **real-time multi-editor collaboration**
- comments, suggestions, and version history
- writing **topic-sized documents** (not micro-pages)
- being part of a broader Drive ecosystem (sharing, permissions, etc.)

But it is **not** a wiki:
- no page tree built into Docs itself
- no native backlinks
- no global “wiki page” concept

## How We Adapt

To keep the **spirit** of a wiki while using Google Docs:

- treat each Doc as a **living topic**, not a frozen article
- keep docs reasonably short and focused
- use comments and suggestion mode for collaboration
- lean on Drive search instead of a page tree
- use @-links to other docs sparsely, where it really helps understanding

We preserve **collaboration and fluidity**, while accepting that Docs is not a classic wiki.
