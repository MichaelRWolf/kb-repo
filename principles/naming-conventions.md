# Naming Conventions

Good names make both **search** and **future AI indexing** much more effective.

## General Pattern

We prefer the pattern:

```text
Topic — Team/Area (optional)
```

Examples:

- `API Authentication — Backend`
- `Offboarding Checklist — PeopleOps`
- `Customer Escalation Playbook`
- `Feature Flags — Platform`

## Guidelines

- Make titles **descriptive**, not clever.
- Reflect **what the doc is about**, not just where it came from.
- Include team/area when it helps disambiguate (`— Backend`, `— Mobile`, etc.).
- Avoid overloading generic titles like “Notes”, “Overview”, or “Misc”.

## Migration-Specific Note

During mechanical migration:

- We may keep the Confluence-derived titles initially.
- Renaming can be done later, selectively, focusing on:
  - high-value docs
  - frequently accessed topics
